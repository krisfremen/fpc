{
  This unit implements some of the utility.library functions for OS 1.x,
  where this library is missing, so the legacy OS support can be implemented
  with minimal changes to the normal system unit and common Amiga-like code

  Please note that this code doesn't aim to be API feature complete, just
  functional enough for the RTL code.
